We\ninvite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon\non Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this\nevent.\n\nOur theme is \"2001: An Energy Odyssey.\" We are using the conference to\nshowcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to\ndeal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as\nenterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to\nclearly define these major themes and priorities than you.\n\nI was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in\nMontreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that\nthe regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=\no\nheart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the\nopportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of\nvital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include\ncomments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both\nguiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in\nmarkets on behalf of enterprises.\n\nThe IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=\nd\nuniversity interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=\nu\nup-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure\nRosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together\nfor you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=\ne\n(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In\naddition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of\nRD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues\nand Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a\njoint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology\nConference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.\n\nFinally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate\nsponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,\nwhich you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=\np\nidentify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary\nsession, \"Sustaining Development\" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn\nthinking around with our re-phrasing).\n\nI hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.

Walker professorship and keynote request\n\n\nThanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\nway of reaching you, is two-fold:\n\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\nother area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\nthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\nBoth Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\nHarold Hook to seek his input.\n\nA few points of elaboration:\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of such\npositions.\n     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the\ncollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my\napproval.\n     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October\n13.\n\nThis name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or with\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\n\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\n\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\n\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\nwill host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\n\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&R\"\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n", "mid": "32998721.1075840286219.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath": "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/122.", "bcc": [], "to": ["walker@missouri.edu"], "replyto": null, "ctype": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname": "122.", "date": "2000-09-08 07:02:00-07:00", "folder": "_sent", "subject": "Re: P.

The economic and \nbusiness climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally \ncompletes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, \nadding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.\n\nIn light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting \n2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican \nInvestment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the \ninauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received \nconfirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank \nGovernor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence \nof the future key cabinet members and state governors.\n\nAs usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders \nto discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future \nbusiness opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main \ntopics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial \nrelationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues \nfor the country's main industries.\n\nPlease consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information \nwill be updated as soon as it becomes available.\n\nFor further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at \n(41 22) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org\n(  ) Please send me more information on the conditions for participation.\n\n(  ) Please send information to:\n\n- Name:\n- Position:\n- Company:\n- Tel.:\n- Fax:\n- E-mail:\n\n( XX ) I am unable to participate in the Mexico Meeting 2000.\n\nPlease tick the appropriate response and return this form to Gisela Galicia \nby fax: (41 22) 786 2744 or via e-mail: mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org\nWe look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n\n\n", "mid": "5372290.1075840286288.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath": "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/125.", "bcc": [], "to": ["mexicomeeting@weforum.org"], "replyto": null, "ctype": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname": "125.", "date": "2000-09-08 12:08:00-07:00", "folder": "_sent", "subject": "Re: World Economic Forum - Mexico Meeting 2000"}

This is not a permanent \nexemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.\n\nMidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's \nreported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, \nKen Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.\n\nThe utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an \namendment to a \"must pass\" piece of legislation during the waning days of \nthis Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' \nstrategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes \ntax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as \ncontributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to \npaid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth \nEdison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. \n2944).\n\nSenator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA \namendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed \nto the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've \nreviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the \nconcept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was \nSenator Kerrey's idea.  \n\nIt is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) \nwould still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact \nthat Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the \nDemocrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not \nhe is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive \nelectricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is \"at least \nthree years away from happening.\"\n\nSteve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position \non this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to \noppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like \nSouthern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the \nMidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access \nprovisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. \n\n\n\n\n", "mid": "23248272.1075840286359.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath": "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/128.", "bcc": ["steven.kean@enron.com", "richard.shapiro@enron.com", "james.steffes@enron.com", "joe.hillings@enron.com", "tom.briggs@enron.com", "joe.hartsoe@enron.com", "sarah.novosel@enron.com", "dwatkiss@bracepatt.com", "awenner@velaw.com"], "to": ["cynthia.sandherr@enron.com"], "replyto": null, "ctype": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname": "128.", "date": "2000-09-10 23:23:00-07:00", "folder": "_sent", "subject": "Re: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language"}
